<span>This is a description of most error messages that can be 
displayed by each DLL.<br>These errors are displayed as Exceptions or logged in the 
debugger ("Out" window).</span></p>
<h2>
<a name="Error categories"></a>Error categories</h2>
<p>
There are 3 very different kinds of error:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>You have designed a type</strong> in a way that makes it 
	incompatible with UniversalSerializer.<br>Please read <a href="Good%20practices.html">Good practices</a>, that may 
	help you in adapting your type.<br>If the type comes from an external DLL, 
	please inform its author about UniversalSerializer.</li>
	<li><strong>A framework (.NET, Silverlight, Mono, etc) type</strong> is not managed 
	correctly.<br>It may require an adaptation in UniversalSerializer. I do not 
	consider that as a true error, it only means a standard type needs more 
	consideration (creation of <a href="Filters.html">filters</a> or
	<a href="Containers.html">containers</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>A general problem in UniversalSerializer.</strong><br>That will 
	let me correct a problem that can potentially affect many programmers.</li>
</ol>

UniversalSerializer.dll</span></h2>


<ol>
	<li><span><strong>Error 1 : This version of UniversalSerializer can not 
	manage multi-dimensional arrays.</strong><br>Multi-dimensional array and 
	not-0-based array serializations are not implemented yet.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 2 : Unknown CustomFormatter.</strong><br>An unknown custom 
	Formatter for serialization is set in the Parameters. Internal formatters are Binary, Xml and 
	JSON. Please note JSON is not available on some frameworks.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 3 : Unknown CustomDeFormatter.</strong><br>An unknown 
	custom Formatter for deserialization is set in the Parameters. Internal formatters are Binary, 
	Xml and JSON. Please note JSON is not available on some frameworks.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 4 : Can not set field '{0}'.'{1}' of type '{2}' 
	with value '{3}' of type '{4}'</strong><br>On deserialization. Most 
	probably a field was removed in a new version of the type. Please contact me 
	if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 5 : Can not set property '{0}'.'{1}' of type '{2}' 
	with value '{3}' of type '{4}'</strong><br>On deserialization. Most 
	probably a property was removed in a new version of the type. Please contact 
	me if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 6 : Type not found: \"{0}\".</strong><br>Can happen during 
	deserialization. Maybe the original type is not available anymore, or has 
	been renamed. Please contact me if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 7 : Unknown file version.</strong><br>The file stream is 
	damaged, or you try to deserialize using an obsolete version of the 
	serializer's DLL.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 8 : Type '{0}' (or one of its sub-data) is not 
	serializable by BCL's BinaryFormatter. (suggestion: try to remove attribute 
	[Serializable], or add an exploitable constructor).</strong><br>On 
	serialization. The type has SerializableAttribute as an attribute, 
	therefore UniversalSerializer uses the BCL BinaryFormatter's function to transcode the 
	instance to a byte array. Unfortunately, this particular function does not work correctly.<br>
	Usually, this is due to a missing or inadequate constructor.<br>If you can 
	modify this type, please read this <a href="Good%20practices.html">document</a>.<br>If not, please 
	contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
	"CLRBinaryFormatterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
	"CLRBinaryFormatterContainer.cs".</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 9 : data is not a Primitive type</strong><br>An 
	internal error. Please contact me.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 10 : Can not cast deserialized type \"{0}\" to 
	wanted type \"{1}\".</strong><br>An internal error. After a successful 
	deserialization, the type is wrong. Please contact me.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 11 : Construction (instanciation) of type \"{0}\" 
	caused an error: {1}.</strong><br>We called a constructor of the type, but that 
	has 
	raised an exception. Maybe the type has been modified between the serialization 
	and the deserialization.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 12 : No exploitable constructor for type {0}</strong><br>
	On deserialization. UniversalSerializer does found an exploitable constructor. No default 
	constructor, no parametric constructor.<br>If you can modify this type, 
	please provide a parametric constructor that follows
	<a href="Good%20practices.html#Constructor">these rules</a>.<br>If not, you 
	can create a <a href="Containers.html">Container</a>. If it is a framework 
	type, please contact me.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 13 : Type {0} has no Add() method nor [Insert() 
	method and Count get method], we can not set its items.</strong><br>The type 
	is an enumeration, not a List. UniversalSerializer needs to be able to add 
	items to this enumeration in order to deserialize it. It tried to find an 
	adequate method, Add or Insert, but did not found one.<br>If you can modify 
	this type, you can inherit it from IList&lt;&gt;. More information
	<a href="Good%20practices.html#List">here</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 14 : Type \"{0}\" can not be constructed because 
	this parameter's type has been disallowed by a filter: Parameter's 
	name=\"{1}\", Corresponding field's name=\"{2}\", 
	Type=\"{3}\".\n\tSuggestion: use a filter to disallow the main type, or to 
	allow the parameter's type.</strong><br>If one of your
	<a href="Filters.html">Filters</a> disallows a field and the parametric 
	constructor needs this field, you have to take a decision: remove this 
	filter or add a new constructor (if you can modify this type).<br>Same 
	problem with the <a href="Attributes.html">Attributes</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Error 15 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as TypeConverter, but 
	it does not convert to string correctly. Please investigate or contact the 
	type's author.</strong><br>The type has TypeConverterAttribute as an attribute, 
	therefore UniversalSerializer uses the provided special function to transcode the 
	instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>
	If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
	contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
	"CLRTypeConverterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
	"CLRTypeConverterContainer.cs".</span></li>
	<li><strong>Error 16 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as TypeConverter, but its 
	transcoding type is unknown. Please investigate or contact the type's 
	author.</strong><br><span>The type has TypeConverterAttribute as an attribute, 
	therefore UniversalSerializer uses the provided function to transcode the 
	instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>
	If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
	contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
	"CLRTypeConverterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
	"CLRTypeConverterContainer.cs".</span></li>
	<li><strong>Error 17 : Listed assembly in stream can not be loaded: \"{0}\". 
	Error={1}</strong><br>Occurs when deserializing a type which assembly can 
	not be loaded.<br>Type's assemblies are listed in the stream on 
	serialization and are necessary for deserialization.</li>
	<li><strong>Error 18 : Warning: DateTimeKind has more than 4 items now. That 
	will cause problems in DateTimes. See ToTicksAndKind().</strong><br>
	Apparently, .NET's 
	DateTimeKind implementation has changed. UniversalSerializer has to be 
	adapted consequently.</li>
	<li><strong>Error 19 : Type {0} can not be deserialized because of 1) an 
	error in its Container and 2) a refused private field.</strong><br>Two 
	cumulative reasons: The container of this type has been cancelled on 
	serialization, probably because it was not able to contain this value. And, 
	one (or more) private fields is (are) refused by a filter because of its 
	type.<br><span>If you can modify this type, remove the container or 
	attribute that cause this error, or remove the private field that is refused 
	by the filters, or modify the filter.<br>If not, please contact me.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Error 20 : (internal) Can not create a TypeManager for type {0}.</strong><br>
	If it is under Silverlight, it may be due to another type, please see 
	sub-exceptions until you find "Error 21".<br>If not Silverlight, that is an unexpected error, please inform me 
	then I can study it.</li>
	<li><strong>Error 21 : Silverlight does not allow creation of a TypeManager 
	for private type {0}.</strong><br>There is a strong security protection in 
	Silverlight that limits type access (usually: a private type in an another 
	assembly).<br>This version of UniversalSerializer can not serialize this 
	type.<br>Suggestion: for now, try to avoid this type or any type that 
	contains it as a field or a property.<br>Sorry, I have no solution at this 
	time.</li>
	<li><strong>Error 22 : </strong><span lang="fr"><strong>Type {0} has a 
	circular type in its constructor parameters in a form that is not supported 
	by the deserializer.</strong><br>This type is constructed by a parametric 
	constructor. One (or more) of its parameters is a circular type.<br>Two 
	situations are not supported:<br>. When a not-indexed Enumerable contains 
	this type, or<br>. when there is a Dictionary&lt;T1, T2&gt; where T1 and T2 are 
	circular types.<br>Possible solutions:<br>. Add a default constructor to the 
	main type.<br>. Use IList in place of not-indexed Enumerables.<br>. Avoid 
	this kind of dictionary.<br>If you can not modify this type, please create a 
	Container, or a Filter, or contact me.</span></li>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Error WPF 1 : No public static field DependencyProperty 
	{0} of type {1} found in type {2}.</strong><br>Occurs when deserializing a 
	DependencyProperty. The type does not define the required field.<br>
	Normally, for each dependency property, a static field should be defined. 
	Example, Window has an "Icon" property, and the static definition of Window 
	has an "IconProperty" field.<br>The static field must have the same name as 
	the DependencyProperty, more "Property".</li>
	<li><strong>Error WPF 2 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as ValueSerializer, but it 
	was not transcoded correctly. Please investigate or contact the author.</strong><br>
	<span>The type has ValueSerializerAttribute as an attribute, 
	therefore UniversalSerializerWPF uses the provided function to transcode the 
	instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
	contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
	"XAMLValueSerializerContainer._IsValidType()", in

<p>There is no public error message for now.</p>
<h2>'<a name="Bugs"></a>Bugs' or defects ?</h2>
<p>What bugs ? You will find products to kill bugs at your local store, if there 
are any in your computer or in your house !&nbsp;&nbsp; ;)</p>
<p>More seriously, this word, 'bug', was a joke on the first decades of computers 
(1940-1960). At that time, 
computers were big monsters where small animals could enter in and give pretexts 
to programmers.<br>60 years after, I feel&nbsp;this word has not much sense 
anymore. 
Today, it is no more a joke, only a technical word that makes nobody laugh. We 
even inherited this horrible neologism, 'debugger', that has really no sense to 
young programmers.</p>
<p>For me, it is time to replace 'bug' by 'error', 'problem', 'defect', 'flaw' or anything 
else. Something clear to programmers and to the public in general.</p>
<p>If you want to do jokes, please invent something adapted to the modern 
reality. Be inventive!</p>
<p>By the way, if you find errors in UniversalSerializer, I will not pretext 
they are due to small animals, virus, secret government agencies intrusions or to 
ETs.<br>Or maybe I'll reply that if I'm looking for a huge pretext !&nbsp;&nbsp; ;)</p>
