<span>This is a description of most error messages that can be 
displayed by each DLL.<br>These errors are displayed as Exceptions or logged in the 
debugger ("Out" window).</span></p>
<h2>
<a id="Error categories"></a>Error categories</h2>
<p>
There are 3 very different kinds of error:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>You have designed a type</code> in a way that make it 
incompatible with UniversalSerializer.<br>Please read <a href="Good_practices.html">Good practices</a>, that may 
help you in adapting your type.<br>If the type comes from an external DLL, 
please inform its author about UniversalSerializer.</li>
<li><code>A framework (.NET, .NET Core, Silverlight, Mono, Xamarin etc) type</code> is not managed 
correctly.<br>It may require an adaptation in UniversalSerializer. I do not 
consider that as a true error, it only means a standard type needs more 
consideration (that is creation of <a href="Filters.html">filters</a> or
<a href="Containers.html">containers</a>).</li>
<li><code>A general problem in UniversalSerializer.</code><br>That will 
let me correct a problem that can potentially affect many programmers.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span>
<a id="Error messages in UniversalSerializer.dll"></a>Error messages in 
UniversalSerializer 3 for NET x_y.dll</span></h2>


<ol>
<li><span><code>Error 1 : This version of UniversalSerializer can not 
manage multi-dimensional arrays.</code><br>Multi-dimensional array and 
not-0-based array serializations are not implemented yet.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 2 : Unknown CustomFormatter.</code><br>An unknown custom 
Formatter for serialization is set in the Parameters. Internal formatters are Binary, XML and 
JSON. Please note JSON is not available on some frameworks.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 3 : Unknown CustomDeFormatter.</code><br>An unknown 
custom Formatter for deserialization is set in the Parameters. Internal formatters are Binary, 
XML and JSON. Please note JSON is not available on some frameworks.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 4 : Can not set field '{0}'.'{1}' of type '{2}' 
with value '{3}' of type '{4}'</code><br>On deserialization. Most 
probably a field was removed in a new version of the type. Please contact me 
if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 5 : Can not set property '{0}'.'{1}' of type '{2}' 
with value '{3}' of type '{4}'</code><br>On deserialization. Most 
probably a property was removed in a new version of the type. Please contact 
me if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 6 : Type not found: \"{0}\".</code><br>Can happen during 
deserialization. Maybe the original type is not available anymore, or has 
been renamed. Please contact me if it is a .NET type (not a custom type).</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 7 : Unknown file version.</code><br>The file stream is 
damaged, or you try to deserialize using an obsolete version of the 
serializer's DLL.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 8 : Type '{0}' (or one of its sub-data) is not 
serializable by BCL's BinaryFormatter. (suggestion: try to remove attribute 
[Serializable], or add an exploitable constructor).</code><br>On 
serialization. The type has SerializableAttribute as an attribute, 
therefore UniversalSerializer uses the BCL BinaryFormatter's function to transcode the 
instance to a byte array. Unfortunately, this particular function does not work correctly.<br>Usually, this is due to a missing or inadequate constructor.<br>If you can 
modify this type, please read this <a href="Good_practices.html">document</a>.<br>If not, please 
contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
"CLRBinaryFormatterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
"CLRBinaryFormatterContainer.cs".</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 9 : data is not a Primitive type</code><br>An 
internal error. Please contact me.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 10 : Can not cast deserialized type \"{0}\" to 
wanted type \"{1}\".</code><br>An internal error. After a successful 
deserialization, the type is wrong. Please contact me.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 11 : Construction (instantiation) of type \"{0}\" 
caused an error: {1}.</code><br>We called a constructor of the type, but that 
has 
raised an exception. Maybe the type has been modified between the serialization 
and the deserialization.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 12 : No exploitable constructor for type {0}</code><br>On deserialization. UniversalSerializer does found an exploitable constructor. No default 
constructor, no parametric constructor.<br>If you can modify this type, 
please provide a parametric constructor that follows
<a href="Good_practices.html#Constructor">these rules</a>.<br>If not, you 
can create a <a href="Containers.html">Container</a>. If it is a framework 
type, please contact me.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 13 : Type {0} has no Add() method nor [Insert() 
method and Count get method], we can not set its items.</code><br>The type 
is an enumeration, not a List. UniversalSerializer needs to be able to add 
items to this enumeration in order to deserialize it. It tried to find an 
adequate method, Add or Insert, but did not found one.<br>If you can modify 
this type, you can inherit it from IList&lt;&gt;. More information
<a href="Good_practices.html#List">here</a>.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 14 : Type \"{0}\" can not be constructed because 
this parameter's type has been disallowed by a filter: Parameter's 
name=\"{1}\", Corresponding field's name=\"{2}\", 
Type=\"{3}\".\n\tSuggestion: use a filter to disallow the main type, or to 
allow the parameter's type.</code><br>If one of your
<a href="Filters.html">Filters</a> disallows a field and the parametric 
constructor needs this field, you have to take a decision: remove this 
filter or add a new constructor (if you can modify this type).<br>Same 
problem with the <a href="Attributes.html">Attributes</a>.</span></li>
<li><span><code>Error 15 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as TypeConverter, but 
it does not convert to string correctly. Please investigate or contact the 
type's author.</code><br>The type has TypeConverterAttribute as an attribute, 
therefore UniversalSerializer uses the provided special function to transcode the 
instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
"CLRTypeConverterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
"CLRTypeConverterContainer.cs".</span></li>
<li><code>Error 16 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as TypeConverter, but its 
transcoding type is unknown. Please investigate or contact the type's 
author.</code><br><span>The type has TypeConverterAttribute as an attribute, 
therefore UniversalSerializer uses the provided function to transcode the 
instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
"CLRTypeConverterContainer._IsValidType()", in 
"CLRTypeConverterContainer.cs".</span></li>
<li><code>Error 17 : Listed assembly in stream can not be loaded: \"{0}\". 
Error={1}</code><br>Occurs when deserializing a type which assembly can 
not be loaded.<br>Type's assemblies are listed in the stream on 
serialization and are necessary for deserialization.</li>
<li><code>Error 18 : Warning: DateTimeKind has more than 4 items now. That 
will cause problems in DateTimes. See ToTicksAndKind().</code><br>Apparently, .NET's 
DateTimeKind implementation has changed. UniversalSerializer has to be 
adapted consequently.</li>
<li><code>Error 19 : Type {0} can not be deserialized because of 1) an 
error in its Container and 2) a refused private field.</code><br>Two 
cumulative reasons: The container of this type has been canceled on 
serialization, probably because it was not able to contain this value. And, 
one (or more) private fields is (are) refused by a filter because of its 
type.<br><span>If you can modify this type, remove the container or 
attribute that cause this error, or remove the private field that is refused 
by the filters, or modify the filter.<br>If not, please contact me.</span></li>
<li><code>Error 20 : (internal) Can not create a TypeManager for type {0}.</code><br>If it is under Silverlight, it may be due to another type, please see 
sub-exceptions until you find "Error 21".<br>If not Silverlight, that is an unexpected error, please inform me 
then I can study it.</li>
<li><code>Error 21 : Silverlight does not allow creation of a TypeManager 
for private type {0}.</code><br>There is a strong security protection in 
Silverlight that limits type access (usually: a private type in another 
assembly).<br>This version of UniversalSerializer can not serialize this 
type.<br>Suggestion: for now, try to avoid this type or any type that 
contains it as a field or a property.<br>Sorry, I have no solution at this 
time.</li>
<li><code>Error 22 : </code><span><code>Type {0} has a 
circular type in its constructor parameters in a form that is not supported 
by the deserializer.</code><br>This type is constructed by a parametric 
constructor. One (or more) of its parameters is a circular type.<br>Two 
situations are not supported:</span><ul>
<li><span>When a not-indexed Enumerable contains 
this type, or</span></li>
<li><span>when there is a Dictionary&lt;T1, T2&gt; where T1 and T2 are 
circular types.<br>Possible solutions:</span></li>
<li><span>Add a default constructor to the 
main type.</span></li>
<li><span>Use IList in place of not-indexed Enumerables.</span></li>
<li><span>Avoid 
this kind of dictionary.<br>If you can not modify this type, please create a 
Container, or a Filter, or contact me.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2><span><a id="Error messages in UniversalSerializerWPF.dll"></a>
Error messages in UniversalSerializer 3 for WPF on NET 4_5.dll</span></h2>


<ol>
<li><code>Error WPF 1 : No public static field DependencyProperty 
{0} of type {1} found in type {2}.</code><br>Occurs when deserializing a 
DependencyProperty. The type does not define the required field.<br>
Normally, for each dependency property, a static field should be defined. 
Example, Window has an "Icon" property, and the static definition of Window 
has an "IconProperty" field.<br>The static field must have the same name as 
the DependencyProperty, more "Property".</li>
<li><code>Error WPF 2 : The type '{0}' uses {1} as ValueSerializer, but it 
was not transcoded correctly. Please investigate or contact the author.</code><br>
<span>The type has ValueSerializerAttribute as an attribute, 
therefore UniversalSerializerWPF uses the provided function to transcode the 
instance to a string. Unfortunately, this function does not work correctly.<br>If you can modify this type, please remove this attribute.<br>If not, please 
contact me and/or add yourself the incorrect type to&nbsp; 
"XAMLValueSerializerContainer._IsValidType()", in 
"XAMLValueSerializerContainer.cs".</span></li>

<h2><span><a id="Error messages in UniversalSerializerWinForm.dll">
</a>Error messages in UniversalSerializer 3 Windows Forms for NET x_y.dll</span></h2>


<p>There is no public error message for now.</p>
<h2>'<a id="Bugs"></a>Bugs' or defects ?</h2>
<p>What <strong>bugs</strong> ? You will find products to kill bugs at your local store, if there 
are any in your computer or in your house !&nbsp;&nbsp; ;)</p>
<p>More seriously, this word, 'bug', was a joke on the first decades of computers 
(1940-1960). At that time, 
computers were big mechanical monsters where small animals could enter in and give pretexts 
to programmers.<br>60 years after, I feel&nbsp;this word has not much sense 
anymore. 
Today, it is no more a joke, only a technical word that makes nobody laugh. We 
even inherited this horrible neologism, 'debugger', that has really no sense to 
young programmers.</p>
<p>For me, it is time to replace 'bug' by 'error', 'problem', 'defect', 'flaw' or anything 
else. Something clear to programmers and to the public in general.</p>
<p>If you want to do jokes, please invent something adapted to the modern 
reality. Be inventive!</p>
<p>By the way, if you find defects in UniversalSerializer, I will not pretext 
they are due to small animals, virus, secret government agencies intrusions or to 
ETs.<br>Or maybe I'll reply that if I'm looking for a huge pretext, after all !&nbsp;&nbsp; ;)</p>
