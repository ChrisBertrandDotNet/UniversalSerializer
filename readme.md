UniversalSerializer is a data serialization library for
.NET/.NET Core/.NET Standard/UWP (Universal Windows)/Mono/Xamarin/Silverlight
on
Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS.

In other words, it saves and loads complex object values/instances to
and from a file or from any stream.
The stream format can be binary, JSON, or XML.  

It has been designed to be able to serialize very complex types with ease (like the WPF's [Window] class for example).

It is free and [open-source].

You will find more information on the official [website].
