Downloaded pre-compiled version r668 from author's site.

You will find compiled DLLs here:
https://code.google.com/p/protobuf-net/
In the archive, look in this directory:
/full/net30

If an exception occurs when using protobuf-net, the DLL could need "IKVM.Reflection.dll". You will find it in the project site, see above.
