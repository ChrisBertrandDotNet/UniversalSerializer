v3.14.5:
Why test structures have been moved to an external DLL ?
That was needed in order to be able to deserialize old (version 2.0) format test files: see project "UniversalSerializer Tester", in "TestFiles".

Remember: this library have to be named "TestTypes", in order to be able to deserialize old files v2.0.
And it must be version 0.0.0.0 .
